# Sequence Analysis Tool

## Description
This tool analyzes genetic sequences from Fasta or GeneBank files. It includes two optional analyses:

1. Longest Repeated Subsequence.
2. GC Content Calculation.

## Features
- Compatible with Fasta and GeneBank format files.
- Command-line interface with optional analyses.

## Usage
Run the program using the command-line interface:

```bash
python analyze.py FILE [--duplicate] [--gc_content]
```

### Arguments:
- `FILE`: Path to the Fasta or GeneBank file.
- `--duplicate`: Perform analysis to find the longest repeated subsequence.
- `--gc_content`: Perform analysis to calculate GC content.

### Examples:
1. Find the longest repeated subsequence:
   ```bash
   python analyze.py example.fasta --duplicate
   ```
2. Calculate GC content:
   ```bash
   python analyze.py example.fasta --gc_content
   ```
3. Perform both analyses:
   ```bash
   python analyze.py example.fasta --duplicate --gc_content
   ```

## Output
- The longest repeated subsequence (if found) will be printed to the console.
- GC content will be displayed as a percentage.
